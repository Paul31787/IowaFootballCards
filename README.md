Iowa Football Trading Cards

Created football trading cards to represent Iowa State University and the University of Iowa's mascots as well as their rivarly for the CyHawk Trophy. I made the cards with html and css. I also applied flexbox to place the three cards on a single page. In addition it allows the cards to be viewable on mobile and if the page is collapsed they shrink and resize appropriately. I had a lot of fun with this project and in the process I learned more about the two universities and their football traditions.
